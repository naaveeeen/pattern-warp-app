Pattern Warp & Cloth Simulation using OpenCV

This project simulates realistic cloth warping by overlaying a 2D pattern onto a flag image with perspective transformation and lighting effects. It's ideal for showcasing logos, emblems, or textures on waving flags or fabrics.

Features:
- Warp pattern based on 4 user-defined corner points and the points selected further for proper mapping
- Apply displacement map from flag texture
- Simulate cloth-like shading using Sobel gradients
- Overlay with realistic blending
- Save results automatically
- Dockerized for portability
